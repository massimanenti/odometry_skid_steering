# odometry_skid_steering

The goals of the project are: <br />
I. compute odometry using skid steering (approximate) kinematic: <br />
- using Euler and Runge-Kutta integration <br />
- ROS parameter specifies initial pose <br />

II. use dynamic reconfigure to select between integration method <br />
III. write 2 services to reset the odometry to (0,0) or to a pose(x,y,Î¸) <br />
IV. publish a custom message with odometry value and type of integration <br />

The bag files come from measurements of a real skid-steering robot.

The file "Assignment" is a description of the problem provided by the professor, the file "Useful_information" is useful in order to understand the code present in the folder "robotics_hw1".
